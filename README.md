# The-Danger
The most dangerous of repositories 

The Danger is a respository of java programs that hopefully grow in complexity.
By Brian Caswell.




The danger, it comes softly yet sweetly. It encompasses all, spares none, but none shall fear. For the danger isn't danger at all but love. The greatest danger being the danger of love. Since love of danger is only hatred of love. So love the danger, it's no danger to love.
